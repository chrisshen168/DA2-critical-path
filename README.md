# Network Models---Project Management
# Part 1: Problem setup.  Describe the work that your team has completed, posting the updated Excel spreadsheet of tasks, completion times, per-hour costs, and persons responsible. Describe any areas of uncertainty regarding project components, time, or cost estimates. Draw a directed graph diagram for the project. Note tasks that can be completed in parallel.

# Part 2: Model specification. Specify a linear programming model for the project plan. Show how time and cost estimates play into the specification. In specifying the objective function, you can make the simplifying assumption that all contributors to the project charge the same hourly rate. That is, a minimum total time solution will be the same as a minimum total cost solution.

# Part 3: Programming. Develop Python PuLP software for the linear programming model.

# Part 4: Solution. Solve the project plan using best-case, expected, and worst-case time estimates with a minimum-time or minimum-cost objective. Describe your solution. Identify the critical path for the project under each scenario. Construct Gantt charts for the best-case, expected, and worst-case solutions.

# Part 5: Overview. Write a brief overview of the project for the prospective client. Ignoring costs associated with software licensing and cloud hosing, what would you charge for the project? When would you expect to be delivering the product prototype? How soon could you deliver the product prototype if additional independent contractors were added to the mix?
